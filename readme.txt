 Project Description
#####################

The pharmaceutical Website is a comprehensive web application created as part of my Web Development Module. The website will allow the user to register and login, aswell as view pharmaceutical products on the website, add, update and remove pharmaceutical products from the catalog in real-time. This will be updated instantly. The website prioritizes efficient navigation and boasts a user-centric GUI.

 Project Requirements
######################

The requirements for this project were very specific. We had to demonstrate our understanding of HTML,CSS,PHP and SQL by creating a pharmaceutical Website. I had to provide a secure user registration and login functionality with data stored in a connected database. I had to enable the users to view, add, edit, and remove pharmaceutical products from the database, ensuring real-time synchronization between the website and the database. We had to allow for efficient navigation throughout the website along with having a very user-centric GUI from every angle including colour, design, spacing. We were given a strict rubric to follow to test our abilities in what we learned.

 Project Implementation
########################

I began by using HTML and CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing and user-centric website. The design prioritised visual appeal from spacing to colours and efficient navigation throughout the website. I used PHPMyAdmin and XAMPP to create a database and to allow for the use of PHP to connect the database to the website. I made sure everything was organised in the XAMPP repository so it all runs smoothly. 

I created two tables in the MySql database called user and products. These will hold the user details and the pharmaceutical products. I then used php to establish connection between the database and the website. Some webpages incorporated both PHP and HTML, while others exclusively featured HTML. A separate CSS stylesheet was employed for styling purposes. 

There are sections to view,add,edit or remove products from the products table in the database. There was a webpage to register and be added to the user database and one to login aswell as a homepage and contact section. Overall navigation around the website was flawless and the database and webpage were synchronized.

I designed various webpages to fulfill different functions, including viewing, adding, editing, or removing products from the database. I designed additional web pages that facilitated user registration and login, with a homepage and contact section completing the website.

Overall, the website's navigation was smooth, and the integration between the database and webpages was seamless.

 What would I add if I had more time:

I would further customize the website to improve the design by recieving input from different users making the website more user-centric.

 Final notes and sources:
##########################

In general, the full development process of this game was an excellent learning experience, in planning out each feature, thinking how to implement each feature, what functions would be required, and debugging/ fixing numerous issues.

This project provided valuable learning experiences in the use of HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL. I also gained experience in terms of planning, feature implementation and debugging. I adhered to the project requirements, and the entire codebase was developed by me, using the knowledge I gained throughout the module.
